        <p class="greentext">HOW TO PREPARE NIGERIAN MOIMOI</p><br>
    </b>
    <p class="greentext"> <b> Ingredients </b>

   <p>1 kg of Mackerel</p>

    7 Cooked Eggs (optional)</p>

    Half cup of vegetable oil</p>

    3 seasoning cubes</p>

    Salt to taste.</p>

    1 cup of sliced onions

    Tatashe or shobo (about 5 to 10, it add the reddish color)</p>

    Crayfish (1 cup)</p>

    3 cups of beans</p><br><br>

    <b><p class="greentext">MOIMOI PREPARATION</p></b>
<br>
    Step 1</p>

    Please add the beans into a bowl, sprinkle a handful of water and start squeezing with your hands.

    This is the easiest way to wash beans; you would be through in 20 minutes.</p>

    Step 2</p>

    You can add a little more water but don’t allow it to soak; continue squeezing until it shades off the outer coat,
    you’d probably be doing this for about 3 minutes.</p>

    Step 3</p>

    When it seems like a good amount of the beans have shaded off their outer-coat, add enough water to fill the bowl.
    The outer coat would rise to the top, sieve and continue squeezing.</p>

    At some point there would be just very few that have not shaded off their outer coat, work on them and keep washing.</p>

    Step 4</p>

    Wash the beans to remove the outer coat, keep squeezing, washing and sieving till you are left with the white beans
    then you can prepare for the grinding part.</p>

  <b>There are people in Nigeria that render the service of grinding food stuff like moi moi or tomatoes in large
    quantity.</b></p>

    Step 5</p>

    Split the red tatashe or shombo into two halves to remove the seeds at the center, this practice is necessary
    because the seeds add a bitter taste to moi moi. Wash and also pluck off the green stem at the top.</p>

    Step 6</p>

    Parboil the fresh /frozen fish, pick out from the water then pieces the fish with your fingers, not really squashing
    (leave in bits).</p>

    What I do at this point is to add all of them (beans, onions, crayfish and tatashe or shobo) in a small clean bowl
    and take to the commercial grinding mill.</p>

   <b>You can use a smart blender for this if you have one, I used my semi-smart blender and it did a perfect job.</b></p><br><br>

  <b>How To Make Moi Moi</b></p><br>

    Step 6</p>

    While still in the bowl, add the fish.</p>

    Step 7</p>

    Pour in the oil into the ground beans – half-cup (125ml), add 2 seasoning cubes, the fish water (fish stock) (which
    must not be over a half cup) salt to taste. Stir and taste the entire mixture.</p>

   <b>I can drop the egg on top after I have distributed the barter in cooking plates.</b></p><br><br>

   <b>How to Cook beans Pudding</b></p><br>
    Step 8</p>

    Distribute in as many plates as possible, some people use wrappers for this purpose. After the distribution, you can
    drop into the cooking pot.</p>

    Step 9</p>

    If you are cooking with plates, you can drop the plates on top of each other but you must drop tiny logs of woods or
    pieces of clothes at the bottom of the pot to avoid burning the plate.</p>

    Some people use the stem of the moi moi wrapper, you don’t really need them if you would be careful.</p>

    Drop the plates in the pot, three or four per row.</p>

    Step 10</p>

    Add water simultaneously making sure it doesn’t top the first plate.</p>

    Then cover tightly and cook for about 40 to 60 minutes adding water at interval to avoid burning or too much water
    that would run into the plates.</p>

    I monitor closely this part because if you allow the pot to dry the plates would start melting especially if you are
    using plastic plates.</p>

   <b>Note that plastic plates can cook for hours without melting or getting burned, the exception is when the pot is
    completely dried.</b></p>

    Step 11</p>

    You can bring out one of the plates after cooking for 40 minutes to check if it is done, check again after ten
    minutes, once it is done, allow to cool off for 30-60 minutes; then serve with pap (akamu), rice or custard</p><br>

   <b>Nigerian (beans pudding) can also be served alone, I love it.</b>
