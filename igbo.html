        <p class="greentext">THE IGBO LAND</p>
    </b>
    <p class="greentext">Igbo, also called Ibo, people living chiefly in southeastern Nigeria who speak Igbo, a language
        of the Benue-Congo branch of the Niger-Congo language family. The Igbo may be grouped into the following main
        cultural divisions: northern, southern, western, eastern or Cross River, and northeastern. Before European
        colonization, the Igbo were not united as a single people but lived in autonomous local communities. By the
        mid-20th century, however, a sense of ethnic identity was strongly developed, and the Igbo-dominated Eastern
        region of Nigeria tried to unilaterally secede from Nigeria in 1967 as the independent nation of Biafra. By the
        turn of the 21st century, the Igbo numbered some 20 million.</p>

        Most Igbo traditionally have been subsistence farmers, their staples being yams, cassava, and taro. The other
        crops they grow include corn (maize), melons, okra, pumpkins, and beans. Among those still engaged in
        agriculture, men are chiefly responsible for yam cultivation, women for other crops. Land is owned communally by
        kinship groups and is made available to individuals for farming and building. Some livestock, important as a
        source of prestige and for use in sacrifices, is kept. The principal exports are palm oil and palm kernels.
        Trading, local crafts, and wage labour also are important in the Igbo economy, and a high literacy rate has
        helped many Igbo to become civil servants and business entrepreneurs in the decades after Nigeria gained
        independence. It is notable that Igbo women engage in trade and are influential in local politics.
