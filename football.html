    <p class="greentext">Football is the most popular sport in Nigeria. The Nigeria national football team
        competes regularly for international titles and many Nigerian footballers compete in Europe, particularly in
        England. Nigeria has one of the finest national teams in Africa and has produced many notable footballers
        including Mudashiru Lawal, Rashidi Yekini, Jay Jay Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu, Vincent Enyeama, Joseph Yobo and Mikel
        John Obi.</p>

    Football was first introduced to Nigeria by the British at the start of the twentieth century. The first
    recorded football match in Nigeria was in 1904. By 1950, football had become the national game of the country.
    </p>

    The Nigeria national football team, nicknamed the Super Eagles, is the national team of Nigeria and is controlled by
    the Nigeria Football Association. According to the FIFA World Rankings, Nigeria, at 39th, are currently the 5th
    best team in the Confederation of African Football.</p>

    The Nigeria national football team played their first international match against Sierra Leone in Freetown on 8
    October 1949. Nigeria won 2–0. Their biggest win recorded was 16–1 against Benin.</p>

    Nigeria's best performances at the World Cup are the 1994, 1998, and 2014 where they reached the second
    round.</p>

    Nigeria's youth teams won the inaugural FIFA U-17 World Cup in 1985 as well as in 1993, 2007, 2013, 2015. The
    under-17 team is known as the Golden Eaglets and Under-20 team is known as the "Flying Eagles".</p>

    Nigeria's Flying Eagles qualified for the first time to represent Africa in the 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship
    in Mexico. Although Nigeria did not go beyond the first round, they beat the highly rated USSR 1-0 and held the
    Netherlands to a goalless draw.</p>

    In 1985, the under-17 football team went to China and conquered the world in the first ever FIFA U-17 World
    Championship. The victory took Nigerian youth football to a high pedestal, setting the stage for a respect of
    Nigeria in international competitions. The under-20 team went to Saudi Arabia for the 1989 FIFA World Youth
    Championship and lost narrowly in the final to Portugal. The team pulled off the now-legendary "Miracle of Damman",
    erasing a 4–0 deficit to the Soviet Union to tie and then win the match by penalties. In 2007, the under-17 squad
    were crowned world champions in South Korea for the 3rd time. Nigeria hosted the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship
    and the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup.
