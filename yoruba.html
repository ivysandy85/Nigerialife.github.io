        <p class="greentext">THE YORUBA CULTURE</p>
    </b>
    <p class="greentext">The Yoruba people are an ethnic group of over 40 million people in total, inhabiting the
        southwestern and north-central region of Nigeria, as well as southern and central Benin. Dating back to as far
        as the transatlantic slave trade, which existed between the 15th to the 19th century, the Yoruba people were
        said to have migrated to other countries as well, including Cuba, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Jamaica,
        Grenada,Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, and Saint Lucia, among others.</p>

        There are reports that civilization already existed in Ile-Ife (the citadel of Yoruba civilization), Nigeria by
        the 8th century, centuries before the arrival of the British colonial administration. Archaeological findings in
        Ile-Ife prove to feature a high level of artistic skills in the 12th–14th century era. Artists sculpted
        traditional and cultural significance out of terracotta, stone, ivory, brass, bronze and copper as far back as
        1300 CE. As of today, after numerous political divisions and influences, the Yoruba are the main ethnic group in
        Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, and Oyo State, and they also make up a sizable proportion of Kwara, Kogi and Edo
        State in Nigeria. They spread to other African countries such as Egypt, Ghana, Togo, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso,
        Ivory Coast and Liberia.</p>

        In Yorubaland, one of the most important traditions observed is ‘orúko àmútọ̀runwá’ – thenaming of a newly born
        child. Names are given to children by their parents, grandparents (paternal and maternal) and some other close
        relatives. A typical Yoruba child can bear as many as 16 different names. The circumstance surrounding the
        child’s birth also plays a significant role to the naming of the child. For instance, a female child born after
        the death of her grandmother is called Yetunde – meaning ‘mother has come again’.</p>

        The institution of marriage is also a very big deal for the Yoruba people, because it is considered to be a
        union of not only the husband and wife but of both families and extended families. When a young man and woman
        meet, they fall in love and both decide whether they’d spend the rest of their lives together. If yes, they let
        their parents know. The man’s parents arrange to meet with the bride’s parents for an introduction. After the
        approval from her parents, they ask the man and his family to provide certain items to pay off her bride price.</p>

        A wedding day is set and is celebrated generously with dancing, eating, drinking and a presentation of gifts to
        the couple. After the wedding, the ‘Ekun Iyawo’ ritual is observed, where the bride is seen crying as she is
        escorted by family, friends and well wishers to her husband’s house – she now leaves her parents and belongs to
        the family of the husband. She is prayed for and her feet are washed in a ritual that is said to cleanse away
        any bad luck she might be bringing into her new home.
